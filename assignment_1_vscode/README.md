Repository Structure

The repository is structured as is the default from the example template included with the ESP-IDF extension of Visual Studio Code.

This default template includes a build and main folder.

The following is taken directly from the example README.md file that explains what files are contained:

  ¦ESP-IDF projects are built using CMake. The project build configuration is contained in `CMakeLists.txt`
  ¦files that provide set of directives and instructions describing the project's source files and targets
  ¦(executable, library, or both). 
  ¦
  ¦Below is short explanation of remaining files in the project folder.
